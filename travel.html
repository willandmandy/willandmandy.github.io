      <h1>Travel & Accommodations</h1>
      <h2>Getting There</h2>
      <p>The venue is up a dirt road 6km north of downtown Hope on the west side of Trans-Can 1. There will be a shuttle from the venue to hotels in Hope. See the "Venue" page for more details on the venue.</p>
      <p><strong>By Air:</strong></p>
      <p>The closest major airport is Vancouver (YVR). There is a bus from Pacific Terminal that stops in Hope, or you can rent a car.</p>
      <p><strong>On the Ground:</strong></p>
	<p>From Vancouver: Take Trans-Can&nbsp;1 EAST to Hope. Tah dah!</p>
	<p>From East/North: Take Trans-Can&nbsp;1 WEST to Kamloops, then stay with BC 5 ("The Coquihalla") heading SOUTH. Turn off onto Trans-Can&nbsp;1 in Hope.</p>
	<p>On Public Transit: There is a train station in Hope serviced by Via Rail, but its service is spotty (it's a flag-stop). There are a few different buses between Vancouver and Calgary or Kamloops that stop in Hope (e.g. Rider Express).
      </p>
      <p>If you're coming from the US by car... it really depends on where you're coming from. Google Maps it.</p>
	


      <h2>Local Accommodations</h2>
      <p><strong>Hotels:</strong></p>
	<p>Hope is a very small town, so its hotels are more on the "quaint" side rather than luxury or chains (note: the "Red Roof Inn" is not the famous American chain). But it does have a lot of them.</p>
      <p>If chain-hotels are desired, <strong>Chilliwack</strong> has many such options about 30 minutes west on Trans-Can&nbsp;1. The Holiday Inn Express is particularly convenient.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Camping/RV:</strong></p>
      <p>Mid-October is chilly, but camping in this area is always a good time in the autumn. Hope has a large number of tent and RV campgrounds, as does E. C. Manning Provincial Park to the East and Skagit Valley Provincial Park to the south.</p>
