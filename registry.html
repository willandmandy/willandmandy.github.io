      <h1>Gifts</h1>

      <h2>Cash?</h2>
      <p>Why yes, we will gladly accept your hard-earned fiat currency. We quite enjoy the feeling of depositing a paper cheque in the bank, but feel free to send an Interac&reg; or Zelle&reg; to Will or Amanda if preferred. CAD and USD are equally acceptable.</p>

      <h2>Objects?</h2>
      <p>Materialism isn't really our jam, so we'd much prefer paper or digital objects that can be exchanged for, say, a honeymoon to Ireland. I believe the term the kids are using these days is "money."<br />
	    But sentimental or meaningful objects are fine too, if that's more to your taste. Please, no kitchenware.</p>

      <h2>No Gift At All?</h2>
      <p>I mean... a Spotify "mixed tape" would be nice, at least, but sure, we'd rather that you came with nothing than that you didn't come at all!</p>
